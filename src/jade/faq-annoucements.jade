      h4 If I was previously approved for access to the Data Portal, will I have to get reapproved? 
      a( onclick="toggle_visibility('a');")
        +fa("fa fa-caret-down fa-lg")
    div.filter#a
      p This is possible, but contingent on the following: 1) CBHSQ has on file your original, complete application, 2) the description of the research in the original application matches with the research you want to do now, 3) all persons listed in the original application are the same persons, and 4) none of the person based contact information has changed compared to the original application.  If all four of these criteria are met, then you do not need to fill out a new application, and CBHSQ will use your original application for the research you propose.
