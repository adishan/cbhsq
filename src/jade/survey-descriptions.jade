    ul.showbullets
      li Substance use treatment by adults ages 18 to 25, and 26 or older
      li Mental health service by adults ages 26 to 49, and 50 or older
    p Trends for most mental health service use are reported for 2008 to 2016; however, trends are not presented for substance use treatment because of methodological changes in 2015.
    p The 
      a Risk and Protective Factors and Estimates of Substance Use Initiation report
      |  (also available in 
      a PDF | 833 KB
      |) presents data regarding the perceived harmfulness of using cigarettes, alcohol, and specific illicit drugs and the perceived availability of substances. Estimates are for specific age groups.
    p The report estimates the perceived great risk of harm associated with the use of marijuana, cocaine, alcohol, and cigarettes alone and also according to whether people initiated use of these substances in the past year. In addition, the report examines youth-specific protective factors, such as perceptions about parents disapproving of youth substance use.
    p Finally, this report estimates how many people initiated substance use in the past year and the average age at first use among them. Statistically significant differences between 2016 and prior years are noted for these various estimates.
    h2 Detailed Tables
